# Barcode E-Reader

An experiment in using barcodes as a storage medium.

The intent is to create an EPUB reader that stores its data on paper. 

Questions:

1. Is this worth persuing?

   Depending on the volume of data that can be stored on paper, this may not be worth doing at all. The time taken to scan a document into the reader may exceed the usefulness of the process.
